CSS can be applied in 3 ways:
1. Inline - using "style" attribute (global attribute). Not recommended way to use most of the time.
2. Internal - used on that same page. We put styles in the <style></style>
3. External - This is used as an efficient way of applying stylesheet. We create a stylesheet with .css suffix/extension
              we link this to all the pages where we want to apply styles using <link> tag.
Note:
- It is recommended to use External Css over any other style sheet.
- Precedence is for inline style sheet over external or internal Css.

CSS Selectors: They are used to tell where should the CSS to be applied.
- Element Selectors: applies to html Element directly.
        element{
            css declaration
        }
- id selector: which is applied to an element with that id.
            #id{

            }
- class selector: class is a global attribute which is used to categorize or group html elements of related type
    we can use class selector to apply CSS to that particular class.
    .class"{
        css declaration
    }
    Eg: .text{
        color: red;
    }
- Pseudo-class selector: these are behavioral properties of html element. mouse hover, onfocus,focusout
    Note:
    - among class element and id, id selector gets highest precedence
