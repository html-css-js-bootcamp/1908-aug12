CSS: Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to add styles to the webpage to make it more appealing for the user.

CSS Rule/Ruleset

selector(means where to apply the CSS){
    property1 : "value1";
    property2 : "value2";
    property3 : "value3";
    .               .
    .               .
    .               .
    .               .
    propertyN : "valueN";
}

Eg: p{
        background: blue;
    }
CSS can be applied in 3 ways:
1. Inline - using style attribute (global attribute). Not recommended way to use most of the time.
2. Internal - used on that same page. We put styles in the <style></style>
3. External - This is used as an efficient way of applying stylesheet. We create a stylesheet with .css suffix/extension
              we link this to all the pages where we want to apply styles using <link> tag.
Note:
- It is recommended to use External Css over any other style sheet.
- Precedence is for inline style sheet over external or internal Css.
