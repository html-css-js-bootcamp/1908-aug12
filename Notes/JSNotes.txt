● Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript?
- It is not Java(its a different programming language which comes under server-side tech)
- It is a Programming language, which is majorly used for front-end technologies.
- It was earlier know as LiveScript. But when Java became super popular they renamed it to JavaScript.
- Further JavaScript became popular and standardised by ECMA(association which maintains standardization of programming languages)
- Since the JS is also known as ECMAScript.
- ES5 - ECMAScript2012, ES6- ECMAScript2015, ES7 ECMAScript 2016.... ES10 ECMAScript 2019

Why JavaScript?
- HTML is used for creating a webpage, CSS adds appealing look and feel to web page but JavaScript
    is used to add behaviour to a web page.

What JavaScript can do?
- JS can create prompts.
- JS can make HTML elements respond to some action
- JS can add HTML elements on fly
- JS can remove HTML elements on fly
- JS can make a call to server or interact with server using XMLHTTPRequest
- JS can enable using 3rd party Apis. Eg: incorporate google maps.
- JS can store values at client side.
- There is a lot that JS can do.

Features/characterstics of JavaScript:
- It is interpretted not compiled.
- It is loosely-typed
- It is case-sensitive. Man and man are treated differently.

Where JavaScript code is executed?
- JS code is first interpreted by the browser Engine then run by it.
- Every browser have their own engines. Eg: Chrome(V8), IE(Chakra),Firefox(Spider Monkey).

● Variables and Datatypes
Variables: they are used to store a value. They values are stored in memory of a browser
    name="Pushpinder Kaur";
    age=27;
    isLive=true;
- we can also create variable by using var or let keyword
    var name;//declaration of the variable
    name="Pushpinder" // allocation/assignation of a value

● Operators and Truth Tables
- (binary- applied on 2 or more)
    - Arithmatic- +,-,/,*,% (modulus- gives you the remainder on division)
    - Logical- &&,||,!
      lets say we have 2 variables a and b with some boolean value
        AND - &&
        OR -||
        NOT - !
    - Assignment- =, +=, -+,*=,/=

    - Comparison- >,<,>=,<=,==,===
- (unary operators- applies to single variable)
    - increment ++
        - post-increment - a++
        - pre-increment - ++a
    - decrement --
        - post-decrement - a--
        - pre-decrement - --a
    - not ! - negation
        !a
- Logical Operators

- Strings: Its an array (collection) of character. We can use " " or ' ' to represent string value.
    In JS there are some in built operations that we can do with strings.
    toUpperCase() - converts string's current case to UPPERCASE.
    toLowerCase() - cunverts string's current case to lowercase.
    charAt() - Returns characters at the specified position.
    some more - splice(), join(), trim() etc.....

● Conditionals
- They are used to check Conditions basically used as checkpoints.
- in JS there are 4 Conditionals:
    - if
    - if-else
    - else-if
    - switch
● Loops: for, while, do-while :
    - Repetiton/iteration
● Functions : Operations which are performed can be encapsulated in a function. You can also say that it encloses 
              logic of the program.
    - You can reuse them as many times as you want.
    - There are different types of functions in JS:
        - Named functions
        - Anonymous functions
        - Arrow functions (new in ES6)
        - functions with parameters
        - function which returns values
        - callback functions
        - IIFE(Immediate Invoked Function Expressions) functions
